# Key Features:
 - Project cards allow ease of implementation. If I finish a new project. I can add it to the project section by simply using a react component that I created.
 - Smooth Scrolling
 - Carousel Cards in the about me section (There could be more cards added in the future but I wanted to keep the about me section brief yet interactive).
 - User Experience implementation with the nav bar. Some research suggests if a nav bar is hidden in a hamburger menu, it is less likely to be used at all. If the user can see it, they are more likely to interact with it. 
 - Nav bar is easy to use on mobile. With bigger phones, it is harder for the user to access the nav bar at the top of their screen with their thumbs, so, the nav bar is on the bottom of the screen for mobile.
